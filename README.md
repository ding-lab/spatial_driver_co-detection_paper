Code for spatial driver co-detection paper

I'm working on it

After installing the r4.3.2 env the libaries ComplexHeatmap and Circlize were installed directly in R with BiocManager rather than conda.

Copy number calling was run with [GATK4SCNA](https://github.com/Aust1nS2/GATK4SCNA).
Scrublet for new snRNA-seq/multiome samples was run with [automated_scrublet](https://github.com/Aust1nS2/automated_scrublet).
H&E images were aligned with [HEX-SIFT](https://github.com/Aust1nS2/HEX-SIFT) as outlined in the worklog file.
